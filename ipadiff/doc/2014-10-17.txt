Hi Joel,

A couple things:

1.  For each of the 3 reports (genes, mp, omim), everything in the header between <channel> and the first instance of <!-- --> can be removed; the iPhone app does not read the file as straight xml anymore, so the header is not needed.

2.  Can we cat the three files together at the end to make one big file of updates called mgiRSS.xml?  All of the <item> data would be enclosed by one set of <rss version="2.0"><channel></channel></rss> tags.  It would save me from having to revamp my getUpdates.php script.

3.  In the <label> tag, can we change the order of info to <symbol><[MGI ID]> instead of the other way around?

4.  In the <update> tags, can we remove the MGI ID from the beginning of the update?

Many thanks,
Jill
